README:

   This directory contains code, help, examples and demo for cluster validation
   alghorithms working as an extention for package "cluster" 

   This is the third verions of package "clv". Package is believed to be tested.
   Any problems, bugs, comments, documentation misunderstandings etc. please send 
   on the following email address: <wookashn at gmail.com>.

RELASE NOTES:

   1. Small documentation fix ater CRAN check.
   2. Fixing small bug in intracluster average diameter 
      (the result was twice smaller than should be).

TODO:

   Next cluster stability approach (based on prediction) is ongoing. The code is there but not 
   available for end user yet. First has to be refactored and tested.

   Create and document R functions for group of matrix cluster scatter measures based 
   indicies such as: Calinski-Harabasz index, Krzanowski & Lai index, Hartigan statistic.

   Create and document R functions that helps to realise relative criteria approach for 
   cluster validation.

SPECIAL THANKS TO:

   Artur Suchwalko for idea of this package and support.
   Przemyslaw Bernacki for preparing and running manual and automated tests.
   Marcin for finding a bug in intracluster average diameter index.
